Clarion Fixer Utility

This utility allows you to make automated changes to your Clarion installation, such as changing all the "MS Sans Serif" and "Arial" fonts mentioned in various templates, to fonts from this century like "Segoe UI" for forms and "Calibri" for reports.

The application is described in much greater detail in the two PDF files included, and the EXEs can be downloaded from my blog

This utility uses CapeSoft WinEvents 5 and CapeSoft StringTheory 3 (not included) so you will need those if you want to make changes.

This application is freeware and is used at your own risk. The example actions work fine on my Clarion 11.1 install, and have been tested on other installs, but you need to follow the instructions and run a test before you use it on your production environment.
